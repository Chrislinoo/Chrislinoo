- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Chrislinoo (Christopher Paulino Hernandez)
- I am interested in a few things. 
  - Physical activity is a huge part of my life. I go to the gym just about daily with some rest days weaved in.
  - Studying is another. Since I am a student , daily study is essential in my current life. Theres so much potential to grow into
  and shape while im still developing myself into the person I want to be.
  - Family shapes my being. I am married and have a 5 year old daughter. I have already outlived the younger mindset some of my peers seem to carry on by the sense of 
  responsibility that I carry knowing I have a family to take care of.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science at Western Governors University. Planned graduation date is May 2025.
